  Guide an MCP work item through its schema-defined lifecycle — filling required notes using

# Schema Workflow

Drive any schema-tagged MCP work item through its gate-enforced lifecycle. This skill is
schema-driven — it reads note requirements and authoring guidance from the item's tag schema
at runtime, never hardcoding what notes should contain.

**When this skill applies:** Any item whose `tags` match a schema defined in
`.taskorchestrator/config.yaml`. Items without matching schemas advance freely (no gates).

---

## Entry Point

Start by loading the item's context:

```
get_context(itemId="<uuid>")
```

The response tells you everything needed to proceed:

| Field | What it means |
|-------|--------------|
| `currentRole` | Which phase the item is in (queue, work, review, terminal) |
| `canAdvance` | Whether the gate is satisfied for the next `start` trigger |
| `missing` | Required notes not yet filled for the current phase |
| `expectedNotes` | All notes defined by the schema, with `exists` and `filled` status |
| `guidancePointer` | Authoring instructions for the first unfilled required note (from schema `guidance` field) |
| `noteSchema` | The full schema definition matching the item's tags |

If `currentRole` is `terminal`, the item is already complete — nothing to do.

If `noteSchema` is null or empty, no schema matches the item's tags. This means either:
- `.taskorchestrator/config.yaml` doesn't exist or has no `note_schemas` section
- The item's tags don't match any configured schema key

Inform the user: "No note schema found for tag `<tag>`. Use `/manage-schemas` to configure gate workflows." The item can still advance freely — this is non-blocking, but gate enforcement won't apply.

---

## Phase Progression Loop

Each phase follows the same pattern: **fill required notes, then advance.**

### Step 1 — Identify missing notes

From `get_context`, check the `missing` array. These are the required notes that must be
filled before the gate allows advancement.

If `missing` is empty and `canAdvance` is true, skip to Step 3.

### Step 2 — Fill notes using guidancePointer

For each missing note, the schema provides authoring guidance via `guidancePointer`. This
is the schema author's instruction for what the note should contain — follow it.

```
manage_notes(
  operation="upsert",
  notes=[{
    itemId: "<uuid>",
    key: "<note-key>",
    role: "<note-role>",
    body: "<content following guidancePointer instructions>"
  }]
)
```

**How guidancePointer works:**
- `get_context` returns `guidancePointer` for the first unfilled required note
- After filling that note, call `get_context` again to get the pointer for the next one
- The pointer comes from the `guidance` field in `.taskorchestrator/config.yaml`
- If `guidancePointer` is null, the note has no specific authoring instructions — use the
  note's `description` field as a general guide

**Batch filling:** If you already know the content for multiple notes (e.g., from a completed
plan or implementation), fill them all in one `manage_notes` call. You only need to re-check
`get_context` between notes when you need the next `guidancePointer` for authoring direction.

### Step 3 — Advance to the next phase

```
advance_item(transitions=[{ itemId: "<uuid>", trigger: "start" }])
```

The response confirms the transition:

| Field | Check |
|-------|-------|
| `applied` | Must be `true` — if `false`, the gate rejected (notes still missing) |
| `previousRole` → `newRole` | Confirms which phase you moved from/to |
| `expectedNotes` | Notes required for the new phase (fill these next) |
| `unblockedItems` | Other items that were waiting on this one |

**If the gate rejects:** The response lists which notes are missing. Fill them (Step 2),
then retry. Do not call `get_context` first — `advance_item` already told you what's needed.

### Step 4 — Repeat or finish

After advancing, check whether the new phase has its own required notes:
- If `expectedNotes` in the advance response shows unfilled required notes → loop back to Step 2
- If `newRole` is `terminal` → the item is complete
- Otherwise, continue work in the new phase and fill notes as progress is made

---

## Phase-Specific Guidance

The schema defines which notes belong to which phase. Common patterns:

| Phase | Typical purpose | When notes get filled |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| queue | Requirements, design, reproduction steps | During planning, before implementation starts |
| work | Implementation notes, test results, fix summaries | During or after implementation |
| review | Deploy notes, verification results | After implementation, during validation |

The actual note keys and content requirements vary per schema — always check `expectedNotes`
rather than assuming specific keys exist.

## Orchestrator vs Subagent Responsibility

**Orchestrator** (this skill's primary user):
- Fills queue-phase notes (requirements, design) during planning
- Dispatches implementation agents with the item UUID — does NOT pre-advance items
- Dispatches review agents after implementation completes
- Performs the final terminal transition after review completes
- Uses this skill for queue-phase note filling and terminal advancement

**Implementation and review agents** (agent-owned-phase model):
- Receive the full phase-aware protocol automatically via the `subagent-start` hook
- Call `advance_item(start)` exactly once to enter their assigned phase
- Fill phase notes using the JIT progression loop described in the hook protocol
- Do NOT call `advance_item` again — the orchestrator handles terminal transitions

**Key invariant:** Agents call `advance_item(start)` once to enter their phase. Only the orchestrator calls `advance_item(complete)` for the terminal transition. The orchestrator never pre-advances items before dispatching agents.

## Creating a New Schema-Tagged Item

When creating a new item with a schema tag:

```
manage_items(
  operation="create",
  items=[{ title: "...", tags: "<schema-tag>", priority: "medium" }]
)
```

Check `expectedNotes` in the response — it lists all notes the schema requires across all
phases. Begin filling queue-phase notes immediately, then follow the progression loop above.

---

## Error Recovery

**Gate rejection:** `advance_item` returns `applied: false` with the missing note keys.
Fill them and retry — no need for a separate `get_context` call.

**Wrong phase notes:** If you try to upsert a note with a `role` that doesn't match the
item's current role, the note is still created (notes are not phase-locked), but it won't
satisfy a gate for a different phase. Always match the note's `role` to the schema definition.

**Blocked items:** If `advance_item` fails because the item is blocked by a dependency,
resolve the blocking item first. Use `get_blocked_items` or `query_dependencies` to diagnose.

**No schema match:** Items whose tags don't match any schema in config.yaml have no gate
enforcement. `advance_item` will succeed without notes. This is by design — only schema-tagged
items require structured note workflows.
