{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"SubagentStart","additionalContext":"MCP Workflow Rules:\n\nSTATUS — Use request_transition(trigger=start|complete|cancel|block|hold). For batch status changes, use the transitions array parameter. NEVER use manage_container update with status fields — use request_transition instead for cascade detection.\n\nPOST-TRANSITION — Check response for cascadeEvents (advance parent entities), unblockedTasks (newly available downstream work), and flow context (activeFlow, flowSequence, flowPosition). Act on cascades and unblocked tasks.\n\nCREATION — manage_container create/update/delete all use arrays (containers array for create/update, ids array for delete). Include templateIds when creating tasks/features for structured workflows — the tool warns if templates are missing.\n\nCOMPLETION — Tasks: summary populated, dependencies resolved, required sections filled. Features: all child tasks terminal. Projects: all features completed.\n\nDEPENDENCIES — Use manage_dependencies with a dependencies array or pattern shortcuts (linear, fan-out, fan-in) for batch creation. Never create dependencies one at a time in a loop.\n\nCLEANUP — When a feature reaches terminal status, its child tasks are automatically deleted (except bug/bugfix/fix/hotfix/critical tagged). Export the feature before completing if task content needs to be preserved."}}
