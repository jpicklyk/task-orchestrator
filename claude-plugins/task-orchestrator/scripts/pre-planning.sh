{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","additionalContext":"Planning mode activated. Follow this workflow:\n\n1. DETERMINE planning depth from the user's request:\n\n   Analyze the prompt for sizing signals:\n   - Quick signals: 'fix', 'typo', 'rename', 'small change', 'just add', single-file scope, obvious approach, explicit simplicity\n   - Standard signals: 'add feature', 'implement', 'build', moderate scope, clear requirements, no architectural uncertainty (THIS IS THE DEFAULT)\n   - Detailed signals: 'redesign', 'refactor the system', 'architect', 'migrate', multi-phase language, design tradeoffs, cross-cutting concerns, long problem statements with constraints\n\n   Work type can force a minimum tier:\n   - Bug fix → min Quick  |  New feature → min Standard\n   - Architecture change → min Detailed  |  Research → min Standard\n\n   DECLARE your determination with a one-line rationale:\n     'Standard-tier — bounded feature with clear requirements.'\n   Only ASK (AskUserQuestion) if signals are genuinely ambiguous.\n\n2. SIZE the work: Project + Features + Tasks (large multi-feature efforts), Feature + Tasks (focused scope, most common), or Standalone Tasks (small items).\n\n3. DISCOVER templates (skip for Quick): Call query_templates for both FEATURE and TASK types. For Standard, recommend: Requirements Specification, Task Implementation, Technical Approach, Test Plan. For Detailed, also include: Feature Plan, Codebase Exploration, Design Decision, Implementation Specification. Mark recommendations with '(Recommended)' in AskUserQuestion.\n\n4. PRESENT template selection (skip for Quick): Show the auto-selected templates based on tier and work type. The user can adjust if needed. Use AskUserQuestion ONLY if the work type is ambiguous (e.g., could be a bug fix or a feature gap). Otherwise, proceed with the recommended set.\n\n5. WRITE the plan. Plan content varies by depth:\n   - Quick: A task breakdown table with title, priority, and one-line description per task. This IS the plan.\n   - Standard: Feature-level requirements/context sections (from templates), plus a task breakdown table (title, priority, one-line scope per task). Enough for the user to approve the work breakdown.\n   - Detailed: Full feature plan using template sections (problem statement, architecture, implementation phases, design decisions, risks, verification). Do NOT list tasks separately — the Implementation Phases section defines the work breakdown. Each phase becomes a task after approval.\n   Templates are the floor, not the ceiling — add content beyond what templates provide.\n\n6. REVISION CHECK: If plan.md already contains an MCP Feature UUID line (<!-- MCP Feature: ... -->), this is a revision. Skip depth/template discovery and focus on what changed.\n\nplan.md is the design document. MCP containers are created only after the user approves. Do not write task UUIDs or detailed task specifications into plan.md — MCP is the task tracker."}}
