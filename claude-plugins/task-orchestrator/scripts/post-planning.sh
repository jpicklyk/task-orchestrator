# PostToolUse hook for ExitPlanMode: Creates MCP containers from approved plan.

{"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PostToolUse","additionalContext":"Plan approved. Materialize the plan into MCP Task Orchestrator containers:\n\n1. READ plan.md and check for an existing MCP Feature UUID line (<!-- MCP Feature: ... -->).\n\n2. NEW PLAN (no UUID): Create containers by deriving tasks from the plan structure:\n   a. Create the feature/project via manage_container(operation='create') with templateIds from confirmed templates. Include summary from plan.\n   b. Derive tasks from the plan structure and create each via manage_container(operation='create', containerType='task') with featureId and templateIds:\n      - Quick plans: one task per row in the task breakdown table.\n      - Standard plans: one task per row in the breakdown table. Apply selected task templates.\n      - Detailed plans: one task per Implementation Phase. Apply appropriate templates based on phase nature (e.g., Codebase Exploration for research phases, Design Decision for architectural choice phases, Implementation Specification for coding phases). Set priority and complexity based on phase scope.\n   c. For plan content beyond what templates provide, add as additional sections via manage_sections(operation='bulkCreate') on the feature container.\n   d. Set up dependencies: phases are sequential by default. Override where the plan notes parallel or independent work.\n   e. Write ONLY the feature UUID to plan.md header as an HTML comment: <!-- MCP Feature: <uuid> -->. Do NOT write individual task UUIDs.\n\n3. REVISION (UUID exists): Query the existing feature via query_container(operation='overview'), compare with plan changes, update via manage_container(operation='update'). Check if tasks need adding, updating, or re-prioritizing.\n\n4. VERIFY: Call get_blocked_tasks(featureId='<uuid>') to confirm the dependency graph is correct.\n\n5. REPORT: Use query_container(operation='overview') to show the user the created container hierarchy with task statuses. This is the task view — not plan.md.\n\n6. SEQUENCING RULE — MATERIALIZATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION:\n   - Phase 1 (Materialize): Steps 1-5 above MUST complete before ANY implementation subagent is dispatched. Task creation within Phase 1 MAY be parallelized across subagents when tasks are independent.\n   - Phase 2 (Implement): Dispatch implementation subagents ONLY after all container UUIDs exist. Every implementation delegation prompt MUST include the MCP task UUID. Implementation agents MUST call request_transition(trigger='start') when beginning work and request_transition(trigger='complete') when done.\n   - NEVER dispatch materialization and implementation in parallel. Implementation agents launched without task UUIDs cannot transition statuses or populate sections, making containers decorative.\n   - If the feature has an 'Execution Notes' section, respect the user's delegation preference.\n\n7. Token efficiency: Use templateIds during create (not separate apply_template). Use manage_sections(operation='bulkCreate') for multiple custom sections. Use manage_container(operation='bulkUpdate') for batch changes.\n\nplan.md is the design document. MCP is the execution tracker. query_container(operation='overview') is the task view."}}
