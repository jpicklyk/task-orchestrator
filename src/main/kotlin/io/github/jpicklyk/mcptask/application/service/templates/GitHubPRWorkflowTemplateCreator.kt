### Prerequisites Check
Before pushing branch and creating PR, ensure GitHub MCP server is available:

1. **GitHub MCP Server Status**
   - Verify GitHub MCP server is running and authenticated
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to check authentication status
   - Ensure proper permissions for repository operations

2. **Repository Access Verification**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to verify repository access
   - Check that you have push permissions to the repository
   - Confirm repository settings and branch protection rules

### Sync with Latest Main Branch
**Critical Step**: Always sync with latest main before creating PR:

1. **Fetch Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Check Main Branch Status**
   ```bash
   # Compare your branch with origin/main
   git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main
   git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
   ```

3. **Sync Strategy Decision**
   Choose appropriate sync strategy based on changes:
   
   **Option A: Rebase (Recommended for clean history)**
   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   # Resolve any conflicts if they arise
   # Test after rebase to ensure functionality works
   ```
   
   **Option B: Merge (If rebase is complex)**
   ```bash
   git merge origin/main
   # Resolve any conflicts if they arise
   # Commit the merge
   ```

4. **Post-Sync Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run build and tests after sync
   ./gradlew build test
   
   # Verify functionality still works as expected
   # Fix any issues introduced by sync
   ```

### Final Pre-Push Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code compiles successfully
- [ ] Branch is synced with latest origin/main
- [ ] No merge conflicts remain
- [ ] Functionality works as expected
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] No sensitive information in code or commits""",

### Review Response Best Practices
Effective communication during review process:

**Acknowledging Feedback**:
```
Thanks for catching this! I've updated the validation logic to handle this edge case in commit abc123.
```

**Explaining Decisions**:
```
I chose this approach because it maintains consistency with the existing pattern in UserService. 
However, I'm open to refactoring if you prefer the alternative approach.
```

**Requesting Clarification**:
```
Could you clarify what you mean by 'more robust error handling'? 
Are you referring to specific exception types or the error message format?

### Pre-Merge Final Validation
Before merging, ensure all requirements are met using GitHub MCP tools:

1. **Check PR Readiness**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to verify all required reviews are approved
   - Check that all CI/CD checks are passing
   - Confirm PR is mergeable (no conflicts)
   - Verify branch is up-to-date with main

2. **Final Requirements Checklist**

### Merge Strategy Selection
Use GitHub MCP tools to merge the PR with appropriate strategy:

1. **Squash and Merge (Recommended for features)**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to perform squash merge
   - Combines all commits into single clean commit
   - Keeps main branch history linear
   - Good for feature branches with many small commits

2. **Merge Commit (For significant features)**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to create merge commit
   - Preserves individual commit history
   - Shows explicit merge point
   - Good when commit history is important

3. **Rebase and Merge (For clean linear history)**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to rebase and merge
   - Creates completely linear history
   - No merge commit
   - Requires clean, well-structured commits

### Post-Merge Cleanup and Verification
After successful merge, perform cleanup:

1. **GitHub Cleanup via MCP**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to delete the remote feature branch
   - Verify PR status shows as "merged"
   - Check that merge commit appears in main branch history

2. **Local Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Switch to main and update
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   
   # Delete local feature branch
   git branch -d [branch-name]
   
   # Verify cleanup
   git branch -a
   ```

3. **Verify Merge Success**
   ```bash
   # Check that changes are in main
   git log --oneline -n 10
   
   # Verify functionality in main branch
   ./gradlew build test
   ```

### Post-Merge Actions
Complete the workflow with follow-up actions using GitHub MCP tools:

1. **Update Related Issues**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to close related issues if not auto-closed
   - Add comments linking to the merged PR
   - Update issue status and labels as needed

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update changelog if maintained
   - Update project documentation if needed
   - Notify team members of significant changes via GitHub MCP tools

3. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to check deployment workflow status
   - Monitor automated deployment if configured
   - Verify deployment success if applicable

### Success Notification
Document successful completion:

1. **Task Updates**
   - Use MCP Task Orchestrator tools to update task status
   - Document lessons learned or issues encountered
   - Note actual effort vs. estimated effort

2. **Team Communication**
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to notify relevant team members
   - Share any important implementation decisions
   - Document any follow-up tasks needed

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- Notify reviewers that conflicts have been resolved

**Failed CI after approval**:
- Use GitHub MCP tools to check detailed failure information
- Fix issues and push updates
- Monitor re-run status via GitHub MCP tools

**Branch protection rule failures**:
- Use GitHub MCP tools to verify all required status checks pass
- Ensure required reviewers have approved
- Check branch is up-to-date with main via GitHub MCP tools""",
