version: "2.0.0"

# ============================================================================
# STATUS PROGRESSION CONFIGURATION (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
# ============================================================================
# Define allowed status flows for features and tasks
# Progression typically moves forward, but can move backward for rework
#
# IMPLEMENTATION: StatusValidator.kt loads and enforces these workflows
# NOTE: This config activates v2.0 mode when setup_claude_orchestration tool is run.
# Without this config, system uses legacy v1.0 enum-based validation.

status_progression:
  features:
    # All valid feature statuses (v2.0) - 10 total statuses
    # Valid feature statuses (defined by FeatureStatus enum):
    # draft, planning, in-development, testing, validating, pending-review,
    # blocked, on-hold, completed, archived, deployed
    #
    # DRAFT: Initial draft state for exploring ideas and rough requirements.
    #        Use when: Feature concept is being explored but not ready for planning.
    #        Next steps: Refine requirements, then move to PLANNING.
    #
    # PLANNING: Defining detailed requirements, breaking down into tasks, and creating technical approach.
    #           Use when: Requirements are clear enough to start decomposing into actionable tasks.
    #           Next steps: Complete task breakdown, then move to IN_DEVELOPMENT.
    #
    # IN_DEVELOPMENT: Active implementation of tasks by specialists.
    #                 Use when: Tasks are being actively worked on by developers.
    #                 Next steps: Complete all tasks, then move to TESTING.
    #
    # TESTING: All development tasks complete, running test suite and validation.
    #          Use when: Implementation finished and ready for quality assurance.
    #          Next steps: Pass all tests, then move to VALIDATING.
    #
    # VALIDATING: Tests passed, performing final validation before completion.
    #             Use when: All tests pass and feature needs final review/approval.
    #             Next steps: Validation complete, move to COMPLETED or PENDING_REVIEW.
    #
    # PENDING_REVIEW: Awaiting human review/approval before marking complete.
    #                 Use when: Feature complete but requires stakeholder sign-off.
    #                 Next steps: Review approved, move to COMPLETED.
    #
    # BLOCKED: Feature blocked by external dependencies, technical issues, or missing resources.
    #          Use when: Cannot proceed due to blockers (API unavailable, infrastructure down, etc.).
    #          Emergency status: Can be entered from any state.
    #          Next steps: Resolve blocker, then resume previous flow.
    #
    # ON_HOLD: Feature temporarily paused due to priority changes, resource constraints, or pending decisions.
    #          Use when: Work paused intentionally (waiting for budget, design decisions, etc.).
    #          Emergency status: Can be entered from any state.
    #          Next steps: Resume when resources available, return to previous status or IN_DEVELOPMENT.
    #
    # COMPLETED: Feature complete, validated, and delivered.
    #            Use when: All work finished, tests pass, validation complete.
    #            Terminal status: No further progression.
    #
    # ARCHIVED: Feature archived for historical reference (obsolete, replaced, or superseded).
    #           Use when: Feature is no longer active but kept for reference.
    #           Emergency status: Can be entered from any state.
    #           Terminal status: No further progression.

    # Default flow for software development
    default_flow: [draft, planning, in-development, testing, validating, completed]

    # Alternative flows for different feature types
    rapid_prototype_flow: [draft, in-development, completed]  # Skip planning/testing
    experimental_flow: [draft, in-development, archived]  # Experiments can skip completion
    with_review_flow: [draft, planning, in-development, testing, validating, pending-review, completed]  # Full review cycle

    # blocked, on-hold, completed, cancelled, deferred, deployed, ready-for-qa, investigating
    #
    # BACKLOG: Task in backlog awaiting prioritization and planning.
    #          Use when: Task identified but not yet scheduled or prioritized.
    #          Next steps: Prioritize task, then move to PENDING.
    #
    # PENDING: Task ready to start, waiting for specialist assignment or available resources.
    #          Use when: Task prioritized and ready for implementation, dependencies met.
    #          Next steps: Assign specialist, move to IN_PROGRESS.
    #
    # IN_PROGRESS: Task actively being worked on by specialist (code being written, docs being drafted).
    #              Use when: Specialist is actively implementing the task.
    #              Next steps: Implementation complete, move to IN_REVIEW or TESTING.
    #
    # IN_REVIEW: Implementation complete, awaiting code review or peer validation.
    #            Use when: Code/work complete and needs human review before testing.
    #            Next steps: Review approved → TESTING, changes needed → CHANGES_REQUESTED.
    #
    # CHANGES_REQUESTED: Review completed with requested changes; task needs rework.

    #
    # TESTING: Implementation complete, running automated test suite or manual QA.
    #          Use when: Code/work ready for quality assurance validation.
    #          Next steps: Tests pass → COMPLETED, tests fail → IN_PROGRESS for fixes.
    #
    # BLOCKED: Task blocked by incomplete dependencies or external issues (API down, missing specs).
    #          Use when: Cannot proceed until blocker is resolved.
    #          Next steps: Resolve blocker, then resume previous status.
    #
    # ON_HOLD: Task temporarily paused due to resource constraints, priority changes, or pending decisions.
    #          Use when: Work intentionally paused (waiting for approval, budget, design decisions).
    #          Next steps: Resume when ready, return to previous status or IN_PROGRESS.
    #
    # COMPLETED: Task finished, validated, and merged/delivered.
    #            Use when: All work complete, tests pass, review approved.
    #            Terminal status: No further progression.
    #
    # CANCELLED: Task explicitly cancelled by user or stakeholder (requirements changed, no longer needed).
    #            Use when: Task work abandoned and will not be completed.
    #            Terminal status: No further progression.
    #
    # DEFERRED: Task postponed indefinitely; may be resumed in future release or sprint.
    #           Use when: Task delayed but not cancelled (low priority, resource constraints).
    #           Terminal status: No further progression (but can be "undeferred" by creating new task).

    # Default flow for standard software development

# ============================================================================
# STATUS VALIDATION RULES (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
# ============================================================================
# Advanced validation rules for status transitions
#
# IMPLEMENTATION: StatusValidator.kt enforces these rules when config is present
# The validator supports flexible workflows with safety guardrails
#
# These rules control how strictly the system enforces workflow progression,
# enabling teams to balance process rigor with practical flexibility.

status_validation:
  # Enforce strict sequential flow (can't skip statuses in defined flows)
  # When true: Must follow default_flow or alternative flows step-by-step
  # When false: Can jump to any allowed status
  #
  # Example with enforce_sequential=true:
  #   ✅ Allowed: pending → in-progress → testing → completed (follows flow)
  #   ❌ Blocked: pending → completed (skips in-progress and testing)
  #
  # Example with enforce_sequential=false:
  #   ✅ Allowed: pending → completed (can skip intermediate steps)
  #
  # Recommendation: Keep true for teams needing process compliance (code review, testing gates).
  #                 Set false for rapid prototyping or small teams with informal processes.
  enforce_sequential: true

  # Allow backward transitions (e.g., testing → in-progress for rework)
  # When true: Can move backwards in flow to fix issues
  # When false: Can only move forward
  #
  # Example with allow_backward=true:
  #   ✅ Allowed: in-review → in-progress (fix review comments)
  #   ✅ Allowed: testing → in-progress (fix failing tests)
  #
  # Example with allow_backward=false:
  #   ❌ Blocked: testing → in-progress (must create new task for fixes)
  #
  # Recommendation: Keep true for iterative development workflows (review cycles, test-fix loops).
  #                 Set false only if your process requires forward-only progression.
  allow_backward: true

  # Allow emergency transitions (blocked, on-hold, archived, cancelled, deferred)
  # When true: Can enter emergency_transitions from any state
  # When false: Emergency statuses follow normal flow rules
  #
  # Example with allow_emergency=true:
  #   ✅ Allowed: in-progress → blocked (dependency fails)
  #   ✅ Allowed: testing → on-hold (urgent priority change)
  #   ✅ Allowed: planning → cancelled (requirements changed)
  #
  # Example with allow_emergency=false:
  #   ❌ Blocked: in-progress → blocked (must follow normal flow)
  #
  # Recommendation: Keep true to handle unexpected blockers, priority shifts, and cancellations.
  #                 Emergency statuses are critical for real-world workflow flexibility.
  allow_emergency: true

  # Validate prerequisites before status change (feature must have tasks, etc.)
  # When true: Enforces business rules like "feature needs tasks before completion"
  # When false: Allows status changes without prerequisite checks
  #
  # Example prerequisite validations (when true):
  #   - Feature cannot move to IN_DEVELOPMENT without at least one task
  #   - Task cannot move to COMPLETED if blocked by incomplete dependencies
  #   - Feature cannot complete if it has incomplete tasks
  #
  # Note: Currently enforces basic validation; full prerequisite system planned for future releases.
  #
  # Recommendation: Keep true to prevent incomplete work from being marked complete.
  #                 Set false only for testing or if managing prerequisites externally.
  validate_prerequisites: true

# ============================================================================
# PARALLEL EXECUTION SETTINGS (❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
# ============================================================================
# Configure how tasks are executed in parallel based on dependencies
#
# PLANNED: Future parallel execution engine for concurrent task processing
# CURRENT: No code reads these settings; parallel execution is manual

parallelism:
  enabled: true                    # Enable parallel task execution
  max_parallel_tasks: 5            # Maximum concurrent tasks
  auto_launch: true                # Auto-launch parallel batches (false = suggest only)
  monitor_interval: 30             # Progress check interval (seconds)

# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW AUTOMATION (❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
# ============================================================================
# Configure automatic workflow behaviors
#
# PLANNED: Automated task creation, specialist assignment, status progression
# CURRENT: No automation engine reads these settings; all actions are manual

automation:
  # Feature and task creation
  auto_create_tasks: true          # Auto-create tasks for simple features
  auto_assign_specialists: true    # Auto-assign specialists based on tags
  auto_progress_status: true       # Auto-progress status when conditions met
  auto_complete_features: false    # Require manual confirmation for completion

  # Template management
  templates:
    auto_discover: true            # Auto-discover available templates
    auto_apply: true               # Auto-apply templates to new entities
    required: []                   # Required template names
    # Example:
    # required:
    #   - "Technical Approach"
    #   - "Testing Strategy"
