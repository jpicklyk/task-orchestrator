# AI Agent Configuration for Task Orchestrator
# This file maps task characteristics to specialized AI agents
#
# Architecture: Direct specialist pattern - orchestrator routes tasks directly to specialists
# using recommend_agent() tool. No intermediary Feature Manager or Task Manager agents.
#
# For detailed documentation, see: docs/agent-orchestration.md

#   - documentation: User-facing docs

# Map workflow activities to agents
# Agent names must match Claude Code subagent_type format (Proper Case with spaces)

# ============================================================================
# TAG MAPPING MAINTENANCE GUIDE
# ============================================================================
#
# HOW TAG MAPPING WORKS:
# - When tasks are created with tags, recommend_agent() checks this file
# - If ANY task tag matches a mapping, that agent is recommended
# - First match in tagPriority order wins (see tagPriority section below)
#
# WHEN TO ADD NEW MAPPINGS:
# - Feature Architect creates features with new domain tags (mobile, devops, security)
# - Tasks created with specialized tags not yet mapped to agents
# - Monthly review of unmapped tags using list_tags() tool
#
# HOW TO ADD NEW MAPPINGS:
# 1. Identify the new tag(s) and determine appropriate specialist agent
# 2. Add new entry to tagMappings section below:
#
#    - task_tags: [your-new-tag, related-tag, synonym-tag]
#      agent: Specialist Agent Name
#      section_tags: [relevant, section, tags]
#
# 3. Update tagPriority section if needed (controls conflict resolution)
# 4. Commit changes to git (agents read this file at runtime)
#
# EXAMPLE - Adding mobile development support:
#
#    - task_tags: [mobile, ios, android, react-native, flutter]
#      agent: Mobile Developer
#      section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, ui-design]
#
# BEST PRACTICES:
# - Use kebab-case for tags: mobile-app, not mobileApp or mobile_app
# - Include synonyms: [mobile, ios, android] covers all mobile platforms
# - Group related technologies: [database, sql, postgres, mysql, mongodb]
# - Update tagPriority when adding high-priority domains (security, bug fixes)
# - Test mapping with recommend_agent(taskId) after adding
#
# DISCOVERY:
# - Find unmapped tags: list_tags(sortBy="count", sortDirection="desc")
# - Check tag usage: get_tag_usage(tag="your-tag")
# - Review existing mappings below for patterns
#
# ============================================================================

# Map task tags to specialized agents
# Agents will be recommended based on task tags matching these patterns
# section_tags specify which section tags the agent should query for efficient context

tagPriority:
  - bug
  - database
  - backend
  - frontend
  - testing
  - documentation
  - planning

# Entity type specific mappings
entityTypes:
  FEATURE:
    # Feature creation and structuring
    authoring: Feature Architect
    # Task breakdown from feature
    breakdown: Planning Specialist

  TASK:
    # Tasks use tag-based selection during implementation
    # No specific agent for general tasks (uses main Claude Code instance)

# ============================================================================
# FALLBACK CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Default specialist when recommend_agent() finds no matching tags

# Default specialist for unmatched tasks
default_specialist: "general-purpose"

# Fallback behavior when no specialist matched
fallback_behavior: "use_default"  # Options: use_default, ask_user, skip
# - use_default: Automatically use default_specialist
# - ask_user: Prompt user to select specialist
# - skip: Don't assign specialist, return no recommendation
