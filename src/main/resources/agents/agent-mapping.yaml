# Recommended section tags:
#   - requirements: What needs to be built
#   - technical-approach: How to build it
#   - implementation: Implementation details

# Map task tags to specialized agents
# Agents will be recommended based on task tags matching these patterns
# section_tags specify which section tags the agent should query for efficient context
