# AI Agent Configuration for Task Orchestrator
# This file maps task characteristics to specialized AI agents

# Recommended section tags:
#   - requirements: What needs to be built
#   - technical-approach: How to build it
#   - implementation: Implementation details
#   - testing-strategy: Testing approach
#   - context: Background information
#   - documentation: User-facing docs

# Map workflow activities to agents
# Agent names must match Claude Code subagent_type format (Proper Case with spaces)

  documentation: Technical Writer
  review: Technical Writer

# Map task tags to specialized agents
# Agents will be recommended based on task tags matching these patterns
# section_tags specify which section tags the agent should query for efficient context
