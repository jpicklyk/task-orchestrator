# Task Orchestrator Configuration
# This file configures orchestration behavior, status progressions, and quality gates
# Version: 2.0.0

version: "2.0.0"

# ============================================================================
# STATUS PROGRESSION CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Define allowed status flows for features and tasks
# Progression typically moves forward, but can move backward for rework
#
# NOTE: This config is activated when setup_claude_agents tool is run.
# Without this config, system uses legacy enum-based validation.

status_progression:
  features:
    # All valid feature statuses (v2.0)

      - planning
      - in-development
      - testing
      - validating
      - pending-review
      - blocked
      - completed
      - archived

    # Default flow for software development
    default_flow:
      - planning           # Initial state, defining requirements
      - in-development     # Active implementation

      - validating         # Tests passed, final validation
