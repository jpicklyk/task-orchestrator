# STATUS PROGRESSION - MINIMAL WORKFLOW
# ============================================================================
# Streamlined status flow with only essential statuses for fast-paced development

status_progression:
  features:
    # MINIMAL FEATURE STATUSES (5 statuses)
    #
    # draft: Quick idea capture, rough notes
    #        → Use when brainstorming or exploring concepts
    #        → Move to in-development when ready to code
    #
    # in-development: Active implementation
    #                 → Use when writing code and building the feature
    #                 → Move to completed when done (no formal testing gate)
    #
    # blocked: Can't proceed due to external dependencies or issues
    #          → Emergency status: Enter from any state when stuck
    #          → Move back to in-development when unblocked
    #
    # on-hold: Intentionally paused (priority shift, waiting for decision)
    #          → Emergency status: Enter from any state to pause work
    #          → Move back to in-development when ready to resume
    #
    # completed: Feature shipped and done
    #            → Terminal status: No further progression
    allowed_statuses:
      - draft

      - completed

    # Simple linear flow: idea → build → done
    default_flow:
      - draft              # Initial idea/concept
      - in-development     # Build it
      - completed          # Ship it

    # Emergency exits (can happen anytime)
    emergency_transitions:
      - blocked           # Hit a blocker
      - on-hold           # Need to pause

    # Terminal statuses
    terminal_statuses:
      - completed

  tasks:
    # MINIMAL TASK STATUSES (7 statuses)
    #
    # pending: Task ready to start
    #          → Use when task is defined and ready for work
    #          → Move to in-progress when you start working
    #
    # in-progress: Actively working on implementation
    #              → Use when coding, documenting, or executing the task
    #              → Move to completed when done
    #
    # testing: Quick validation before marking done
    #          → Use when you want to verify functionality works
    #          → Optional: Can skip straight to completed if confident
    #          → Move to completed when validated
    #
    # blocked: Can't proceed until blocker resolved
    #          → Use when dependencies incomplete or external issues
    #          → Move back to in-progress when unblocked
    #
    # on-hold: Task paused intentionally
    #          → Use when priority changes or waiting for decisions
    #          → Move back to in-progress when resuming
    #
    # completed: Task finished and validated
    #            → Terminal status: Work is done
    #
    # cancelled: Task no longer needed
    #            → Terminal status: Explicitly abandoned

# ============================================================================
# STATUS VALIDATION RULES - FLEXIBLE SETTINGS
# ============================================================================
# Relaxed validation for fast iteration

status_validation:
  # Allow skipping intermediate statuses (e.g., pending → completed directly)
  # Vibe coders often move fast and may skip testing/validation when confident
  enforce_sequential: false

  # Allow moving backward (e.g., testing → in-progress to fix issues)
  # Essential for iterative development
  allow_backward: true

  # Allow emergency transitions (blocked, on-hold) from any state
  # Critical for handling unexpected blockers and priority shifts
  allow_emergency: true

  # Minimal prerequisite validation
  # Don't block progress with strict requirements
  validate_prerequisites: false

# ============================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT TAG CONVENTION
# ============================================================================
# Tag tasks with deployment environment to track where features are deployed
#
# USAGE: Add environment tags to tasks to indicate deployment status
#
# Environment tags (use as task tags):
#   - env:local       → Feature running on local development machine
#   - env:dev         → Deployed to development environment
#   - env:staging     → Deployed to staging environment for testing
#   - env:prod        → Deployed to production (live)
#
# Examples:
#   Task: "Deploy user authentication"
#   Tags: backend, deployment, env:staging
#   → Indicates auth feature deployed to staging environment
#
#   Task: "Implement payment gateway"
#   Tags: backend, api, env:local
#   → Indicates payment feature only tested locally so far
#
# Why use environment tags:
#   - Track deployment progress across environments
#   - Quickly see which features are production-ready
#   - Coordinate deployments with clear visibility
#   - Query by environment: search_tasks(tags="env:prod")
#
# Recommended workflow:
#   1. Task starts with env:local (development)
#   2. Add env:dev when deployed to dev environment
#   3. Add env:staging when promoted to staging
#   4. Add env:prod when shipped to production
#   5. Keep all tags (shows full deployment history)

# WORKFLOW TIPS FOR VIBE CODERS
# ============================================================================
#
# Speed up your workflow:
#   1. Use quick_flow for tasks you're confident about (skip testing)
#   2. Set enforce_sequential=false to jump statuses when needed
#   3. Minimal statuses = less overhead, faster decisions
#
# When to use each status:
#   - draft: Brainstorming, not ready to code yet
#   - in-development: Actively coding (most time spent here)
#   - testing: Quick sanity check before shipping
#   - blocked: External blocker, can't proceed right now
#   - on-hold: Intentionally paused (priority change, waiting for info)
#   - completed: Shipped and done
#
# Common patterns:
#   - Feature → draft → in-development → completed
#   - Task → pending → in-progress → completed (skip testing if confident)
#   - Hit a blocker → blocked → (resolve) → in-progress
#   - Priority shift → on-hold → (later) → in-development
#
# Pro tips:
#   - Use blocked for external dependencies (API down, waiting on teammate)
#   - Use on-hold for intentional pauses (priority changes, waiting for decisions)
#   - Don't overthink status choices - pick what feels right and move fast
#   - cancelled is okay - not everything needs to ship, abandon dead ends
