# Output-Style Removal in v2.0

## What Changed

Task Orchestrator v2.0 migrated from the deprecated `.claude/output-styles/` system to Claude Code plugins.

## Impact

- **Removed**: `.claude/output-styles/task-orchestrator.md`
- **Added**: `.claude/plugins/task-orchestrator/` with SessionStart hook

## Migration Steps

### For New Installations
No action needed. Run `setup_claude_orchestration` and plugin is automatically installed.

### For Existing v1.x Users
1. Run `setup_claude_orchestration` to install the plugin
2. **Delete** `.claude/output-styles/task-orchestrator.md` (no longer used)
3. Restart Claude Code session

## Verification

After migration, verify plugin is active:

1. Start new Claude Code session
2. Check for orchestration communication style in responses
3. Verify `.claude/plugins/task-orchestrator/` directory exists

## Benefits

- **Standards Compliant**: Uses official Claude Code plugin system
- **Better Control**: SessionStart hooks provide precise timing
- **Future Proof**: Follows Anthropic's recommended architecture
- **Maintainable**: Clearer separation of concerns

## Rollback

If needed, you can manually create `.claude/output-styles/task-orchestrator.md` with the old content, but this is not recommended as output-styles are deprecated by Anthropic.
