## Overview

The MCP Task Orchestrator implements a **3-level agent coordination architecture** that enables scalable AI workflows with minimal token usage. This system coordinates multiple AI agents working together on complex projects while maintaining context isolation and efficiency.

### 🚀 Quick Start

**Before using the agent orchestration system**, you must run the setup tool:

```
User: "Setup Claude Code agents"
```

This creates the `.claude/agents/` directory with all agent definitions required for Claude Code sub-agent support. Without this step, sub-agents will not be available.

See [Setup Tool](#setup-tool) for complete details.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

Traditional single-agent AI workflows face several challenges:

1. **Context Overload**: Single agent accumulates massive context from all tasks
2. **Lack of Specialization**: One agent tries to handle all work types
3. **Poor Scaling**: Adding more work increases context linearly
4. **No Coordination**: Multiple agents risk conflicts and duplication

### How Agent Orchestration Solves This

The 3-level architecture provides:

- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Specialized agents at each level (feature, task, specialist)
- **Context Isolation**: Each sub-agent starts with clean context
- **Automatic Routing**: Task tags automatically select the right specialist
- **Token Efficiency**: Summary sections enable knowledge transfer at ~300-500 tokens
- **Dependency Awareness**: Task Manager passes completed dependency context to specialists

### Orchestrator-Driven Model

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT**: Sub-agents CANNOT launch other sub-agents. Only the orchestrator can invoke sub-agents.

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents infinite agent chains
- Ensures orchestrator maintains workflow control
- Keeps conversation history at orchestrator level
- Allows orchestrator to adapt workflow based on progress

**Workflow Pattern**:
```
1. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START → recommends task
2. Orchestrator → Task Manager START → recommends specialist
3. Orchestrator → Specialist → performs work → returns brief
4. Orchestrator → Task Manager END → summarizes work
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until feature complete
6. Orchestrator → Feature Manager END → summarizes feature
```

### Key Design Principles

#### 1. Context Isolation

Each sub-agent invocation starts with **clean context**:
- No context inheritance from orchestrator
- Only task/feature data provided
- Previous work accessible via Summary sections
- Results in ~90% token reduction vs. shared context

#### 2. Bookends Pattern

Both Feature Manager and Task Manager use START/END modes:

**START Mode**: Prepare and analyze
- Feature Manager: Analyze feature, recommend next task
- Task Manager: Read task, recommend specialist

**END Mode**: Summarize and complete
- Feature Manager: Create feature summary, mark complete
- Task Manager: Extract specialist output, create task summary

**Benefits**:
- Minimizes token usage through selective reading
- Separates preparation from completion
- Enables dependency context passing

#### 3. Summary Sections

Structured markdown summaries enable knowledge transfer:
- Created by Task Manager END mode
- Token-efficient (~300-500 tokens)
- Used by dependency context, feature summaries, historical reference
- Preserve essential knowledge without full context

**Summary Section Format**:
```markdown
### Completed
[What was accomplished]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file.kt` - [what changed]

### Next Steps
[What depends on this or comes next]

### Notes
[Important technical decisions]
```

#### 4. Automatic Specialist Selection

The `recommend_agent` tool provides intelligent routing:
- Reads `agent-mapping.yaml` configuration
- Matches task tags to specialist capabilities
- Returns exact agent name and reasoning
- Includes section tags for focused context

**Task Manager must call this tool** - no manual inference allowed.

---

## Agent-Mapping Configuration

### Purpose

The `agent-mapping.yaml` file maps task and feature characteristics to specialized AI agents. This enables:

- **Automatic Specialist Selection**: Task tags determine which agent handles the work
- **Focused Context**: Section tags tell specialists which sections to prioritize
- **Consistent Routing**: Same tags always route to same specialist
- **Easy Customization**: Add custom agents by editing YAML

### Configuration Structure

**File Location**: `src/main/resources/agents/agent-mapping.yaml`

```yaml
# Map workflow activities to agents
workflowPhases:
  planning: Planning Specialist
  documentation: Technical Writer
  review: Technical Writer

# Map task tags to specialized agents
tagMappings:
  - task_tags: [backend, api, service, kotlin, rest]
    agent: Backend Engineer
    section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, implementation]

  - task_tags: [frontend, ui, react, vue, web]
    agent: Frontend Developer
    section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, design, ux]

  - task_tags: [database, migration, schema, sql, flyway]
    agent: Database Engineer
    section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, data-model]

  - task_tags: [testing, test, qa, quality, coverage]
    agent: Test Engineer
    section_tags: [requirements, testing-strategy, acceptance-criteria]

  - task_tags: [documentation, docs, user-docs, api-docs, guide]
    agent: Technical Writer
    section_tags: [requirements, context, documentation]

  - task_tags: [planning, requirements, specification, architecture]
    agent: Planning Specialist
    section_tags: [context, requirements, technical-approach]

# Priority order when multiple tags match (first match wins)
tagPriority:
  - database
  - backend
  - frontend
  - testing
  - documentation
  - planning
```

### Tag-Based Agent Selection

**How It Works**:

1. Task Manager calls `recommend_agent(taskId='...')`
2. Tool reads task tags (e.g., `["backend", "api", "rest"]`)
3. Tool reads `agent-mapping.yaml` tag mappings
4. Tool finds first matching mapping (according to tagPriority)
5. Tool returns:
   - `agent`: "Backend Engineer"
   - `reason`: "Task tags match backend category (matched: backend, api, rest)"
   - `matchedTags`: ["backend", "api", "rest"]
   - `sectionTags`: ["requirements", "technical-approach", "implementation"]

**Priority Resolution**:
- If task has both "backend" and "frontend" tags, "backend" wins (higher priority)
- If no tags match, tool recommends general agent or returns error
- Priority order prevents ambiguous routing

### Customizing Agent Mappings

To add a custom agent:

1. **Create agent definition file** (see [Agent Definition Files](#agent-definition-files))

2. **Add mapping to `agent-mapping.yaml`**:
```yaml
tagMappings:
  - task_tags: [mobile, ios, android, react-native]
    agent: Mobile Developer
    section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, implementation, platform-specific]
```

3. **Update tag priority** (if needed):
```yaml
tagPriority:
  - mobile      # Add here if mobile should take precedence
  - database
  - backend
  # ...
```

4. **Use in tasks**:
```
Task tags: ["mobile", "ios", "ui"]
→ Routes to "Mobile Developer"
→ Focuses on: requirements, technical-approach, implementation, platform-specific sections
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use consistent tag naming (lowercase, hyphenated)
- List most specific tags first in tagPriority
- Include 3-5 section tags per mapping
- Test routing with `recommend_agent` tool

## Feature Manager Agent

### Role and Responsibilities

The Feature Manager operates at the **feature level**, coordinating multi-task workflows:

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Analyze feature progress and task completion status
- Recommend next task to work on (dependency-aware)
- Track feature-level status transitions
- Create feature-level summaries when complete

**Key Characteristic**: Interface agent between orchestrator and Task Manager. Does NOT perform implementation work.

### Feature Manager START Mode

**Purpose**: Analyze feature and recommend next task to orchestrator

**Workflow Steps**:

#### Step 1: Read Feature with Full Context
```
get_feature(id='[feature-id]',
            includeTasks=true,
            includeTaskDependencies=true,
            includeTaskCounts=true)
```

**Why Full Context**: Need to see all tasks, their status, and dependencies to make intelligent recommendation.

#### Step 2: Analyze Feature State

From Step 1 data:
- Review task completion status (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Check `taskCounts.byStatus` for progress metrics
- Calculate progress: completed / total
- Review dependency information

#### Step 3: Get Next Task Recommendation
```
get_next_task(featureId='[feature-id]', limit=3, includeDetails=true)
```

**Key Feature**: Tool automatically filters blocked tasks, so results are safe to recommend.

#### Step 4: Update Feature Status (if needed)

If feature is in "planning" and recommending first task:
```
update_feature(id='[feature-id]', status='in-development')
```

#### Step 5: Return Recommendation to Orchestrator

**Format (unblocked task available)**:
```
Feature: User Authentication
Progress: 3/8 tasks completed
Status: in-development

Next Task: Implement OAuth token refresh
Task ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Priority: high
Complexity: 5
Reason: Unblocked, high priority, blocks 2 other tasks

Context: Refresh tokens expire after 30 days. Need automatic refresh
mechanism to maintain user sessions without re-authentication.

Next: Orchestrator should launch Task Manager START for this task.
```

**Format (all tasks complete)**:
```
Feature: User Authentication
Progress: 8/8 tasks completed
Status: All tasks complete

Next: Orchestrator should call Feature Manager END to complete this feature.
```

**Format (tasks blocked)**:
```
Feature: User Authentication
Progress: 6/8 tasks completed
Blocked: 2 tasks are blocked by incomplete dependencies

Blocked Tasks:
- Integration testing (blocked by: OAuth implementation)
- Load testing (blocked by: Integration testing)

Next: Review and resolve blocking dependencies before proceeding.
```

### Feature Manager END Mode

**Purpose**: Summarize completed feature work and close the feature

**What Feature Manager Receives**: Orchestrator provides summaries from all completed tasks (or references to where to find them).

**Workflow Steps**:

#### Step 1: Extract Feature-Level Insights

If task summaries provided by orchestrator, use them directly.
Otherwise:
```
get_feature(id='[feature-id]', includeTasks=true, includeSections=true)
```

**Identify**:
- Overall accomplishment (what feature delivers)
- Tasks completed (brief list)
- Files changed (consolidated across all tasks)
- Key technical decisions (architecture, design patterns, libraries)
- Testing coverage
- Integration points
- Next steps (follow-up work)

#### Step 2: Create Feature Summary Section

```
add_section(
  entityType='FEATURE',
  entityId='[feature-id]',
  title='Summary',
  usageDescription='Summary of completed feature work including tasks, files, and technical decisions',
  content='[markdown content below]',
  contentFormat='MARKDOWN',
  ordinal=999,
  tags='summary,completion'
)
```

**Summary Content Format**:
```markdown
### What Was Built
[2-3 sentences describing the feature outcome and value delivered]

### Tasks Completed
1. **[Task 1 title]** - [1 sentence: what it did]
2. **[Task 2 title]** - [1 sentence: what it did]
3. **[Task 3 title]** - [1 sentence: what it did]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.kt` - [what changed]
- `path/to/file2.kt` - [what changed]
- `path/to/file3.sql` - [what changed]

### Technical Decisions
- [Key decision 1 and rationale]
- [Key decision 2 and rationale]
- [Architecture pattern or design choice]

### Testing
[Brief overview of test coverage - unit tests, integration tests, etc.]

### Integration Points
[What systems/components this feature integrates with]

### Next Steps
[Any follow-up work, related features, or technical debt noted]
```

#### Step 3: Mark Feature Complete
```
update_feature(id='[feature-id]', status='completed')
```

#### Step 4: Return Brief Summary

**Keep it concise** - Summary section has the details:
```
Feature: User Authentication
Status: Completed
Tasks: 8/8 completed
Summary section created

Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication with token refresh, rate limiting,
and session management. All endpoints tested with 95% code coverage.
Ready for integration with frontend.
```

### Feature Manager Token Optimization

**START Mode**:
- Full feature read required (~1-2k tokens depending on task count)
- Necessary to make intelligent recommendations
- Trade-off: Spend tokens once to coordinate efficiently

**END Mode**:
- If orchestrator provides task summaries, use them directly (~2k tokens total)
- Only read feature if needed (~3-5k tokens)
- Don't re-read individual task details
- Aim for ~50% token savings vs full re-read

**Overall Efficiency**: Feature Manager enables orchestrator to work with brief summaries while maintaining full feature awareness.

---

## Task Manager Agent

### Task Manager Role

The Task Manager operates at the **task level**, coordinating specialist routing:

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Read task details and call `recommend_agent` for specialist selection
- Read completed dependency summaries and include in brief
- Prepare orchestrator brief with specialist recommendation
- Extract specialist output and create task summaries
- Mark tasks complete

**Key Characteristic**: Interface agent between orchestrator and specialists. Does NOT perform implementation work.

### Task Manager START Mode

**Purpose**: Prepare task and brief orchestrator on specialist needs

**Mode Detection**: Orchestrator provides task ID only (no specialist output)

**Workflow Steps**:

#### Step 1: Read the Task
```
get_task(id='[task-id]', includeSections=true)
```

**Execute this first** to get task details, summary, tags, sections.

#### Step 2: Get Agent Recommendation (REQUIRED)
```
recommend_agent(taskId='[task-id]')
```

**CRITICAL**: Task Manager MUST execute this tool call. Do not skip or try to infer manually.

**Response Provides**:
- `agent`: Exact agent name (use EXACTLY as provided)
- `reason`: Why this agent was selected
- `matchedTags`: Which tags matched
- `sectionTags`: Which section tags specialist should focus on

#### Step 2.5: Check for Dependencies (if task has dependencies)

```
get_task_dependencies(taskId='[task-id]',
                      direction='incoming',
                      includeTaskInfo=true)
```

If task has incoming dependencies (tasks that block this one):

**For each COMPLETED dependency**:
```
get_sections(entityType='TASK',
             entityId='[dependency-task-id]',
             tags='summary')
```

**Dependency Context Strategy**:
- Only read COMPLETED dependencies (status='completed')
- Ignore pending/in-progress dependencies (specialist can't use them yet)
- Get Summary section only (concise, ~300-500 tokens)
- Include in brief to orchestrator

**Why This Matters**:
- Dependencies often contain critical context (schemas, APIs, decisions)
- Summary sections are token-efficient
- Specialist needs context to build on previous work

#### Step 3: Set Task In-Progress
```
set_status(id='[task-id]', status='in-progress')
```

#### Step 4: Return Recommendation to Orchestrator

**Format WITHOUT Dependencies**:
```
Task: Implement user login endpoint
Specialist: Backend Engineer
Reason: Task tags match backend category (matched: backend, api, rest)
Focus: requirements, technical-approach, implementation
Context: Create POST /auth/login endpoint with email/password authentication
and JWT token generation.

Next: Orchestrator should launch Backend Engineer agent to complete this task.
```

**Format WITH Dependencies**:
```
Task: Create API endpoints for user management
Specialist: Backend Engineer
Reason: Task tags match backend category (matched: backend, api, rest)
Focus: requirements, technical-approach, implementation
Context: Implement REST endpoints for user CRUD operations using the
database schema created in previous task.

Dependencies (1 completed):
─────────────────────────
Task: Create database schema for users
Status: Completed
Summary: Created Users table with id (UUID), username, email, password_hash,
created_at, updated_at. Added unique constraints on username and email.
Implemented proper indexing for email lookups.
Files: src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__create_users_table.sql
─────────────────────────

Next: Orchestrator should launch Backend Engineer agent to complete this task.
```

**Remember**: You provide the recommendation - orchestrator launches the specialist.

### Task Manager END Mode

**Purpose**: Extract specialist work and close the task

**Mode Detection**: Orchestrator provides task ID + specialist output text

**What Task Manager Receives**: The orchestrator provides the specialist's complete output.

**Workflow Steps**:

#### Step 1: Extract Key Information from Specialist Output

Read through specialist output and identify:
- What was accomplished
- Which files were changed
- What comes next
- Important technical decisions

#### Step 2: Create Summary Section

```
add_section(
  entityType='TASK',
  entityId='[task-id]',
  title='Summary',
  usageDescription='Summary of completed task including files changed and next steps',
  content='[markdown content below]',
  contentFormat='MARKDOWN',
  ordinal=0,
  tags='summary,completion'
)
```

**Summary Content Format**:
```markdown
### Completed
[What was accomplished]

### Files Changed
- `path/to/file1.kt` - [what changed]
- `path/to/file2.sql` - [what changed]

### Next Steps
[What depends on this or comes next]

### Notes
[Any important technical decisions or considerations]
```

#### Step 3: Mark Complete
```
set_status(id='[task-id]', status='completed')
```

#### Step 4: Return Brief Summary

**Format**: 2-3 sentences maximum
**Content**: Specific file names and next actions

**Examples**:

✅ "Completed database schema. Created V3__add_task_summary.sql migration and updated Task entity with summary field. Ready for MCP tool updates."

✅ "Implemented OAuth endpoints. Added UserController with login/register/refresh methods, JWT token service, and integration tests. Ready for frontend integration."

❌ "Successfully completed the task!" (too vague)

### Dependency Context Passing

**The Innovation**: Task Manager reads Summary sections from completed dependencies and includes them in the brief to the orchestrator. The orchestrator then passes this context to the specialist.

**Example Flow**:

1. **Task T1** (Database Schema): Specialist creates users table
   - Task Manager END creates Summary: "Created Users table with id, username, email..."

2. **Task T2** (API Endpoints): Depends on T1
   - Task Manager START reads T1's Summary section
   - Includes in brief: "Dependencies (1 completed): Task: Create database schema... Summary: Created Users table..."
   - Orchestrator launches Backend Engineer with this context
   - Backend Engineer builds API using schema from T1 summary

**Benefits**:
- Specialist has everything needed without reading T1 directly
- Token-efficient: ~300-500 tokens vs. thousands
- Enables building on previous work seamlessly
- Works across different specialists

### Task Manager Token Optimization

**START Mode**:
- Must read task (~1-2k tokens unavoidable)
- Must call recommend_agent (~500 tokens)
- May read dependency summaries (~300-500 tokens each)
- Total: ~2-4k tokens typical

**END Mode**:
- Does NOT read task (specialist already did)
- Only extracts from specialist output provided by orchestrator
- Creates Summary section (~500 tokens)
- Total: ~500-1k tokens

**Overall Pattern**: Saves ~50% tokens by avoiding duplicate task reads. Specialist and Task Manager END never both read the full task.

- **Focus**: requirements, technical-approach, implementation
- **Responsibilities**: REST APIs, services, business logic, database integration

#### Frontend Developer
- **Tags**: frontend, ui, react, vue, angular, web
- **Focus**: requirements, technical-approach, design, ux
- **Responsibilities**: UI components, state management, API integration

#### Database Engineer
- **Tags**: database, migration, schema, sql, flyway
- **Focus**: requirements, technical-approach, data-model
- **Responsibilities**: Schemas, migrations, query optimization, indexing

#### Test Engineer
- **Tags**: testing, test, qa, quality, coverage
- **Focus**: requirements, testing-strategy, acceptance-criteria
- **Responsibilities**: Unit tests, integration tests, test automation, coverage

#### Technical Writer
- **Tags**: documentation, docs, user-docs, api-docs, guide, readme
- **Focus**: requirements, context, documentation
- **Responsibilities**: API docs, user guides, README files, code comments

#### Planning Specialist
- **Tags**: planning, requirements, specification, architecture, design
- **Focus**: context, requirements, technical-approach
- **Responsibilities**: Requirements analysis, architecture, design decisions

### Specialist Workflow Pattern

All specialists follow the same workflow:

**Step 1: Read the Task**
```
get_task(id='[task-id]', includeSections=true)
```

Specialists receive the full task context including dependency summaries passed by orchestrator.

**Step 2: Do the Work**

Perform specialized implementation:
- Write code (Backend, Frontend, Database)
- Write tests (Test Engineer)
- Write documentation (Technical Writer)
- Create plans (Planning Specialist)

Use file tools:
- `Read` - Read existing files
- `Edit` - Make precise changes
- `Write` - Create new files
- `Bash` - Run commands
- `Grep` - Search codebase
- `Glob` - Find files

**Step 3: Update Task Sections**

Update sections with results:
```
update_section_text(id='[section-id]',
                    oldText='[placeholder]',
                    newText='[actual content]')
```

Or add new sections:
```
add_section(entityType='TASK',
            entityId='[task-id]',
            title='Implementation Notes',
            content='[details]',
            ordinal=10)
```

**Step 4: Mark Complete**
```
set_status(id='[task-id]', status='completed')
```

**Step 5: Return Brief Summary**

**Format**: 2-3 sentences
**Content**: What was implemented, what's ready next
**Important**: Do NOT include full code in response

**Example**:
```
Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication endpoints in UserController.kt.
Added JWT token generation, refresh logic, and rate limiting middleware.
All endpoints tested with 95% coverage. Ready for frontend integration.
```

### Section Tag Filtering

**Recommended Pattern**: Specialists should focus on sections tagged with their `sectionTags` from `recommend_agent`.

**Example**:
```
recommend_agent returns: sectionTags: ["requirements", "technical-approach", "implementation"]

Specialist reads task:
get_task(id='...', includeSections=true)

Specialist filters sections:
- Priority 1: requirements, technical-approach, implementation
- Priority 2: context, testing-strategy
- Priority 3: Other sections as needed
```

**Benefits**:
- Focuses specialist attention on relevant content
- Reduces token usage by prioritizing key sections
- Enables faster specialist work

**Implementation**:
```
get_sections(entityType='TASK',
             entityId='[task-id]',
             tags='requirements,technical-approach,implementation')
```

## Complete Workflow Examples

### Single Task Workflow

**Scenario**: Implement a single task with no dependencies

**Workflow**:

```
1. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START
   - Feature Manager analyzes feature
   - Recommends Task: "Implement login endpoint"
   - Returns: "Next: Orchestrator should launch Task Manager START"

2. Orchestrator → Task Manager START
   - Reads task
   - Calls recommend_agent → "Backend Engineer"
   - No dependencies
   - Returns: "Specialist: Backend Engineer. Focus: requirements, technical-approach, implementation"

3. Orchestrator → Backend Engineer
   - Reads task with sections
   - Implements login endpoint
   - Writes UserController.kt, authentication service, tests
   - Marks complete
   - Returns: "Implemented login endpoint. Created UserController with authentication logic and tests."

4. Orchestrator → Task Manager END (with Backend Engineer output)
   - Extracts: files changed, what's ready
   - Creates Summary section
   - Marks complete
   - Returns: "Completed login endpoint. UserController.kt and tests created. Ready for frontend integration."

5. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START (next iteration)
   - Recommends next task or signals feature complete
```

**Token Usage**:
- Feature Manager START: ~1.5k tokens
- Task Manager START: ~2k tokens
- Backend Engineer: ~3k tokens
- Task Manager END: ~500 tokens
- **Total: ~7k tokens** (vs. ~20k with shared context)

### Feature with Dependency Chain

**Scenario**: Feature with 3 tasks in sequence (T1 → T2 → T3)

**Tasks**:
- T1: Create database schema (Database Engineer)
- T2: Implement API endpoints (Backend Engineer) - depends on T1
- T3: Add integration tests (Test Engineer) - depends on T2

**Workflow**:

```
ITERATION 1: Task T1
───────────────────────
1. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START
   - Recommends T1 (database schema)

2. Orchestrator → Task Manager START (T1)
   - recommend_agent → "Database Engineer"
   - No dependencies (first task)
   - Returns brief

3. Orchestrator → Database Engineer
   - Creates migration, schema
   - Returns brief

4. Orchestrator → Task Manager END (T1)
   - Creates Summary: "Created Users table with id, username, email, password_hash..."
   - Marks T1 complete

ITERATION 2: Task T2 (Depends on T1)
───────────────────────
5. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START
   - Recommends T2 (API endpoints)

6. Orchestrator → Task Manager START (T2)
   - recommend_agent → "Backend Engineer"
   - Reads T1 Summary: "Created Users table..."
   - Returns brief WITH dependency context

7. Orchestrator → Backend Engineer (with T1 context)
   - Reads task + T1 Summary from orchestrator
   - Implements API using T1 schema
   - Returns brief

8. Orchestrator → Task Manager END (T2)
   - Creates Summary: "Implemented user CRUD endpoints using Users table from T1..."
   - Marks T2 complete

ITERATION 3: Task T3 (Depends on T2)
───────────────────────
9. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START
   - Recommends T3 (integration tests)

10. Orchestrator → Task Manager START (T3)
    - recommend_agent → "Test Engineer"
    - Reads T2 Summary: "Implemented user CRUD endpoints..."
    - Returns brief WITH dependency context

11. Orchestrator → Test Engineer (with T2 context)
    - Reads task + T2 Summary
    - Creates integration tests for T2 endpoints
    - Returns brief

12. Orchestrator → Task Manager END (T3)
    - Creates Summary: "Created integration tests for user CRUD endpoints..."
    - Marks T3 complete

FEATURE COMPLETION
───────────────────────
13. Orchestrator → Feature Manager START
    - All tasks complete
    - Returns: "Next: Call Feature Manager END"

14. Orchestrator → Feature Manager END
    - Reads T1, T2, T3 Summaries
    - Creates feature Summary
    - Marks feature complete
    - Returns brief
```

**Token Usage** (approximate):
- Iterations 1-3: ~7k tokens each = ~21k
- Feature Manager iterations: ~1.5k × 4 = ~6k
- Feature Manager END: ~3k
- **Total: ~30k tokens** (vs. ~100k+ with shared context)

**Key Benefits**:
- Each specialist gets relevant dependency context
- No specialist needs to read all previous tasks
- Context efficient through Summary sections
- Sequential execution ensures proper order

### Parallel Work Opportunities

**Scenario**: Feature with 5 tasks, some can run in parallel

**Task Dependency Graph**:
```
T1 (Database Schema) ────┐
                         ├──→ T3 (API Endpoints) ──→ T5 (Integration Tests)
T2 (Authentication) ─────┘            ↓
                                      T4 (UI Components)
```

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- T1 and T2 can run in parallel (no dependencies)
- After T1 and T2 complete, T3 can start
- After T3 completes, T4 and T5 can run in parallel

**Orchestrator Strategy**:

```
ITERATION 1: Start T1 and T2 in parallel
───────────────────────────────────────
Feature Manager → Recommends T1 (both T1 and T2 are unblocked)
User decides to also start T2

Orchestrator launches:
- T1 workflow (Database Engineer)
- T2 workflow (Backend Engineer)

Both complete independently, create Summaries

ITERATION 2: Start T3 (depends on T1 and T2)
───────────────────────────────────────
Feature Manager → Recommends T3
Task Manager START (T3) → Reads T1 and T2 Summaries
Backend Engineer → Uses T1 schema and T2 auth
T3 completes

ITERATION 3: Start T4 and T5 in parallel
───────────────────────────────────────
Feature Manager → Recommends T4
User decides to also start T5

Orchestrator launches:
- T4 workflow (Frontend Developer, uses T3 Summary)
- T5 workflow (Test Engineer, uses T3 Summary)

Both complete independently
```

**Collision Prevention**: Built-in locking prevents conflicts when multiple specialists try to update the same task simultaneously.

### Multi-Feature Project

**Scenario**: Project with 3 features, features can run in parallel

**Project Structure**:
```
Project: E-commerce Platform
├── Feature 1: User Authentication (5 tasks)
├── Feature 2: Product Catalog (7 tasks)
└── Feature 3: Shopping Cart (6 tasks)
```

**Parallel Feature Development**:

```
FEATURE 1 WORKFLOW (User Authentication)
──────────────────────────────────────
Orchestrator works with Feature Manager for Feature 1:
- Iterate through 5 tasks
- Create feature Summary
- Mark Feature 1 complete

FEATURE 2 WORKFLOW (Product Catalog) - Can run in parallel
──────────────────────────────────────
Orchestrator (or different orchestrator) works with Feature Manager for Feature 2:
- Iterate through 7 tasks
- Create feature Summary
- Mark Feature 2 complete

FEATURE 3 WORKFLOW (Shopping Cart) - Might depend on Feature 1 and 2
──────────────────────────────────────
After Features 1 and 2 complete:
- Orchestrator works with Feature Manager for Feature 3
- Tasks can reference Feature 1 and 2 Summaries
- Iterate through 6 tasks
- Create feature Summary
- Mark Feature 3 complete
```

**Cross-Feature Dependencies**: If Feature 3 tasks depend on Feature 1 or 2 work, task summaries from those features can be passed as context.

## Token Efficiency and Scaling

### Context Isolation

**The Problem with Shared Context**:
- Single orchestrator accumulates all conversation history
- Every tool call and response adds to context
- Context grows linearly with work done
- Eventually hits context limits

**How Context Isolation Solves This**:

```
SHARED CONTEXT MODEL (Traditional):
─────────────────────────────────────
Orchestrator Context: [Task 1] [Task 2] [Task 3] [Task 4] [Task 5]
Tokens: 5k + 8k + 7k + 9k + 6k = 35k tokens

SUB-AGENT MODEL (Task Orchestrator):
─────────────────────────────────────
Orchestrator Context: [T1 brief] [T2 brief] [T3 brief] [T4 brief] [T5 brief]
Tokens: 200 + 200 + 200 + 200 + 200 = 1k tokens

Sub-Agent Contexts (isolated, don't accumulate):
- Task Manager T1: 2k tokens (discarded after)
- Specialist T1: 3k tokens (discarded after)
- Task Manager T2: 2k tokens (discarded after)
- Specialist T2: 3k tokens (discarded after)
- ...

Total Orchestrator Context: ~1k tokens
Peak Sub-Agent Context: ~3k tokens
Savings: 97% reduction in orchestrator context
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Orchestrator context remains manageable indefinitely
- Can handle unlimited tasks without context growth
- Sub-agents work with fresh, focused context
- Enables long-running projects

### Summary Sections

**The Knowledge Transfer Problem**:
- Task T2 needs to know what Task T1 did
- Traditional: Read all of T1 (5-10k tokens)
- Summary Section: Read T1 Summary (300-500 tokens)

**Summary Section Format**:
```markdown
### Completed
Created Users table with authentication fields and indexes

### Files Changed
- `db/migration/V3__create_users_table.sql` - Users table schema
- `src/model/User.kt` - User domain model

### Next Steps
API endpoints can use this schema for user CRUD operations

### Notes
Used UUID for ID, bcrypt for password hashing, added email uniqueness constraint
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Full task context: 5-10k tokens
- Summary section: 300-500 tokens
- **Savings: 90-95%**

**Quality vs. Efficiency**:
- Summary preserves essential knowledge
- Enough context for dependent work
- Detailed work remains in task sections
- Can always read full task if needed

### Bookends Pattern

**START and END modes minimize token usage**:

**Task Manager START**:
- Must read task (unavoidable ~2k tokens)
- Must call recommend_agent (~500 tokens)
- May read dependency summaries (~300-500 tokens each)
- Returns brief to orchestrator (~200 tokens)

**Specialist**:
- Receives brief from orchestrator (~500 tokens including dependency context)
- Reads task (~2k tokens)
- Performs work
- Returns brief (~200 tokens)

**Task Manager END**:
- Receives specialist brief from orchestrator (~200 tokens)
- Does NOT read task (specialist already did)
- Extracts key info, creates Summary (~500 tokens)
- Returns brief (~200 tokens)

**Token Savings**:
- Task Manager START + END: ~3k tokens
- Specialist: ~2.5k tokens
- **Total: ~5.5k tokens**
- **vs. Single agent reading task 3 times: ~6k tokens**

The pattern prevents duplicate task reads while ensuring proper handoff.

### Why This Architecture Scales

**Linear Scaling**:
- Each task costs ~7k tokens total (Feature Manager, Task Manager, Specialist)
- Orchestrator context grows by ~200 tokens per task (brief only)
- 100 tasks = ~700k tokens spent total, but only ~20k in orchestrator context
- Can handle thousands of tasks without context overflow

**Parallel Scaling**:
- Multiple specialists can work simultaneously
- Each specialist has isolated context
- No context sharing or conflicts
- Near-linear speedup with parallelism

**Feature Scaling**:
- Features can be worked on in parallel
- Each feature has independent Feature Manager invocations
- Feature Summaries enable cross-feature dependencies
- Project size doesn't affect per-feature cost

**Comparison**:
```
SHARED CONTEXT: O(n) context growth
- 10 tasks: ~100k orchestrator context
- 100 tasks: ~1M orchestrator context (impossible)

AGENT ORCHESTRATION: O(1) context growth
- 10 tasks: ~2k orchestrator context
- 100 tasks: ~20k orchestrator context (manageable)
- 1000 tasks: ~200k orchestrator context (still viable)
```

## Setup and Configuration

### Agent Definition Files

Agent definitions are stored in two locations:

**User-Editable**: `.claude/agents/*.md`
- Feature Manager, Task Manager, and all specialists
- Users can edit these directly
- Changes take effect immediately

**Embedded (Docker)**: `src/main/resources/agents/claude/*.md`
- Copies of agent definitions packaged in JAR
- Used when running in Docker
- Ensures agents available in all environments

**Agent Definition Format**:

```markdown
---
name: Backend Engineer
description: Specialized in backend API development
tools: mcp__task-orchestrator__get_task, mcp__task-orchestrator__add_section, Read, Edit, Write
model: sonnet
---

# Backend Engineer Agent

You are a backend specialist focused on REST APIs, services, and business logic.

## Workflow (Follow this order)

1. **Read the task**: `get_task(id='...', includeSections=true)`
2. **Do your work**: Write services, APIs, business logic, tests
3. **Update task sections** with your results
4. **Mark complete**: `set_status(id='...', status='completed')`
5. **Return brief summary** (2-3 sentences)

[Additional guidance...]
```

### Setup Tool

⚠️ **REQUIRED FIRST STEP**: You must run the setup tool before using the agent orchestration system.

**Tool**: `setup_claude_agents`

**Purpose**: Creates `.claude/agents/` directory with all agent definitions required for Claude Code sub-agent support.

**When to Run**:
- ✅ **New project setup**: First time using Task Orchestrator with Claude Code
- ✅ **After cloning repository**: If `.claude/agents/` directory doesn't exist
- ✅ **New Claude Code integration**: When connecting Task Orchestrator to a new Claude Code instance
- ✅ **Agent definition updates**: To restore default agent definitions

**How to Run**:

```
User: "Setup Claude Code agents"

AI Response:
1. Runs setup_claude_agents tool
2. Creates .claude/agents/ directory
3. Writes 8 agent definition files
4. Reports: "Claude Code agents installed. You can now use Feature Manager and Task Manager workflows."
```

**Alternative command**:
```
User: "Run setup_claude_agents"
```

**What It Creates**:
- `.claude/agents/feature-manager.md` - Feature-level coordination
- `.claude/agents/task-manager.md` - Task-level coordination and routing
- `.claude/agents/backend-engineer.md` - Backend/API development
- `.claude/agents/database-engineer.md` - Database/migration work
- `.claude/agents/frontend-developer.md` - Frontend/UI development
- `.claude/agents/test-engineer.md` - Testing and QA
- `.claude/agents/technical-writer.md` - Documentation
- `.claude/agents/planning-specialist.md` - Requirements and planning

**Important Notes**:
- This tool is **idempotent** - safe to run multiple times
- Will **not overwrite** existing files (preserves your customizations)
- Only creates files that don't already exist
- The `.claude/agents/` directory is used by Claude Code to discover and load sub-agents
- **Without this setup, Claude Code sub-agents will not be available**

### Customization Options

#### Adding a New Specialist

1. **Create agent definition file**: `.claude/agents/mobile-developer.md`
```markdown
---
name: Mobile Developer
description: Specialized in mobile app development
tools: mcp__task-orchestrator__get_task, mcp__task-orchestrator__add_section, Read, Edit, Write
model: sonnet
---

# Mobile Developer Agent

You are a mobile specialist focused on iOS, Android, and React Native.

[Workflow and guidance...]
```

2. **Add to agent-mapping.yaml**:
```yaml
tagMappings:
  - task_tags: [mobile, ios, android, react-native]
    agent: Mobile Developer
    section_tags: [requirements, technical-approach, implementation, platform-specific]
```

3. **Test with recommend_agent**:
```
Task with tags: ["mobile", "ios", "ui"]
→ recommend_agent returns: "Mobile Developer"
```

#### Modifying Existing Agents

Edit agent definition files in `.claude/agents/`:

**Example**: Add specific guidance to Backend Engineer

```markdown
## Coding Standards

- Use Kotlin coroutines for async operations
- Follow Clean Architecture patterns
- Write comprehensive unit tests (90%+ coverage)
- Document all public APIs with KDoc

## Project-Specific Patterns

- Use Exposed ORM for database access
- Follow repository pattern
- Return Result<T> for error handling
```

Changes take effect immediately for new agent invocations.

#### Changing Agent-Mapping Priority

Edit `src/main/resources/agents/agent-mapping.yaml`:

```yaml
# Prioritize mobile over backend for ambiguous tasks
tagPriority:
  - mobile       # Check mobile tags first
  - database     # Then database
  - backend      # Then backend
  - frontend
  - testing
  - documentation
  - planning
```

**Impact**: Tasks with both "mobile" and "backend" tags will route to Mobile Developer.

## Best Practices

### For Orchestrators (Main Claude Instance)

1. **Always use Feature Manager for multi-task features**
   - Let Feature Manager coordinate task order
   - Don't try to manage task sequence manually
   - Trust dependency-aware recommendations

2. **Pass full dependency context to specialists**
   - Task Manager provides brief with dependency summaries
   - Include this context when launching specialist
   - Don't abbreviate or summarize further

3. **Use briefs to maintain clean context**
   - Only keep brief summaries in your context
   - Don't internalize full specialist responses
   - Let Summary sections preserve detailed knowledge

4. **Launch agents sequentially unless parallel is safe**
   - Wait for task completion before starting dependent task
   - Parallel execution only for truly independent tasks
   - Built-in locking prevents conflicts but not logic errors

5. **Check feature status regularly**
   - Use Feature Manager START periodically
   - Understand progress and blockers
   - Adjust plans based on recommendations

### For Sub-Agents (Feature Manager, Task Manager, Specialists)

1. **Feature Manager: Trust get_next_task**
   - Don't manually select from task list
   - Tool handles dependency filtering automatically
   - Recommend exactly what tool suggests

2. **Task Manager: Always call recommend_agent**
   - Never infer specialist manually
   - Use exact agent name from response
   - Include section tags in brief

3. **Task Manager: Read all completed dependency summaries**
   - Don't skip dependencies
   - Include full context in brief
   - Better to over-inform than under-inform

4. **Specialists: Keep responses brief**
   - 2-3 sentences maximum
   - Mention specific file names
   - Detailed work goes in task sections

5. **All sub-agents: Update task sections**
   - Don't return work inline
   - Use add_section or update_section_text
   - Preserve work for future reference

### For Users

1. **Tag tasks consistently**
   - Use lowercase, hyphenated tags
   - Apply functional tags (backend, frontend, database)
   - Apply type tags (feature, bug, enhancement)

2. **Trust the agent routing**
   - Tags determine specialist assignment
   - System selects appropriate agent automatically
   - Override only when truly needed

3. **Review feature progress periodically**
   - Ask "What's the status of [feature]?"
   - Orchestrator will use Feature Manager
   - Get clear progress and blockers

4. **Define dependencies early**
   - Create dependencies when creating tasks
   - Clear dependencies enable automatic workflow
   - Prevents out-of-order execution

5. **Read summaries for project understanding**
   - Task summaries capture essential knowledge
   - Feature summaries show high-level progress
   - More efficient than reading all sections

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Task Manager Not Calling recommend_agent

**Symptoms**: Task Manager tries to infer specialist manually

**Solution**:
- Remind Task Manager: "You must call recommend_agent tool"
- Check Task Manager agent definition includes recommend_agent in tools list
- Verify agent-mapping.yaml is accessible

### Issue: Dependency Context Not Passed

**Symptoms**: Specialist doesn't have context from previous tasks

**Solution**:
- Check Task Manager START is reading dependency summaries
- Verify dependencies are marked "completed"
- Ensure Task Manager included dependencies in brief
- Confirm orchestrator passed context to specialist

### Issue: Specialist Returns Full Code in Response

**Symptoms**: Specialist response contains hundreds of lines of code

**Solution**:
- Remind specialist: "Return brief summary only (2-3 sentences)"
- Emphasize: "Detailed work goes in task sections"
- Check specialist agent definition emphasizes brief responses

### Issue: Feature Manager Recommends Blocked Task

**Symptoms**: Feature Manager recommends task that has incomplete dependencies

**Solution**:
- Verify Feature Manager is using get_next_task tool
- Check that get_next_task is called correctly
- get_next_task automatically filters blocked tasks - trust the tool

### Issue: Wrong Specialist Selected

**Symptoms**: Backend task assigned to Frontend Developer

**Solution**:
- Check task tags match agent-mapping.yaml patterns
- Verify tagPriority order is correct
- Confirm recommend_agent is being called
- Review matchedTags in recommend_agent response

### Issue: Orchestrator Context Growing Large

**Symptoms**: Orchestrator context approaching limits

**Solution**:
- Verify orchestrator is only keeping brief summaries
- Check that full specialist responses are discarded
- Ensure detailed work stored in task sections, not context
- Consider splitting into multiple features if project very large

### Issue: Agents Not Found

**Symptoms**: "Agent definition not found" error

**Solution**:
- Run setup_claude_agents tool
- Verify .claude/agents/ directory exists
- Check agent name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Confirm agent-mapping.yaml uses correct agent names

### Issue: Task Manager END Not Executed

**Symptoms**: Task marked complete but no Summary section

**Solution**:
- Orchestrator must call Task Manager END after specialist completes
- Pass specialist output to Task Manager END
- Verify Task Manager END mode is detected (task ID + output provided)
- Check that add_section is working correctly

### Issue: Feature Never Completes

**Symptoms**: All tasks done but feature stays "in-development"

**Solution**:
- Call Feature Manager END explicitly
- Feature Manager checks all tasks complete, marks feature complete
- Verify no tasks are in "pending" or "in-progress" status
